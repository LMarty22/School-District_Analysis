# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

Upon completion of the initial school district data analysis for Py City schools, Maria was notified that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. Due to the highly confidential nature of student scores and money distribution based on scores, it is imperative that scores are reported accurately for future budgeting forecasting. As a result, analysis must be completed once more, representative of the removal of Thomas High School(THS) student data for 9th graders. Thomas High School students in 9ths grade had their math and reading scores replaced with NaN for the purpose of this analysis. 

## Results

Analysis was completed using the provided district data, alterations were completed based on the new findings of possible dishonestly at Thomas High School 9th grade. Overall district level results almost no impact.

Effects of replacement of 9th grade scores at Thomas High School have also made almost no impact on the overall evaluation of district data. The 9th grade class at THS is comprised of 461 students, which is about 1% of the total student data being analyzed, as a result the impact on the district level is granule.

	
During the THS analysis, there is a deep dive into the math, and reading scoring as well as the overall passing for the students. In relation to other schools, THS high school remains a top performing school, THS remains in the top 5 performing schools in the district.

	-  Math scores increased by .04%
	-  Reading scores decreased by .29%
	-  Overall students passing  percent decreased by .31%



### School Budget 
Evaluating the per student budget in reference to student math and reading scores indicates that higher budget does not indicate that student academic scores will be higher. Schools with the highest overall passing percentage are the schools with lowest spending per student. Cabrera High School per student funding is in the first percentile, however it has the highest overall passing percentage in the district at 91.33%. Meanwhile the lowest performing school, Rodriguez High School funding per student is the 3rd percentile. The difference in per student budget between the highest performer and lowest performer is $55 per student.

###School Size
School size seems to be the indicator for higher scores amongst students. Schools classified as "Small" and "Medium" have the highest overall passing percentage, separated by 1% difference respectively. It can be further inferred that school size directly impacts student performance.

###School Type
Schools classified as "Charter" have an 36% higher overall passing rate compared to "District" schools. "Charter" schools tend to score higher academically. The top 5 performing schools in PyCity school district are all "Charter" schools. The bottom 5 performing schools are all classified as "District" schools.

## Summary

The overall school district analysis remained similar to the initial anaylsis outcome. The replacement of 9th grade students at Thomas High School with NaN, did not greatly influence the overall performance of the district. The district can continue to move forward with bugdgeting decision making based on the data presented as the impact of the second analysis, ran without the 9th graders at Thomas High School. The 9th grade at THS student count represents less than 1% of total student data. The removal of 9th grade scores does impact Thomas High School math and reading scores averages and the overall passing percentages. Although the numbers do change for math and reading slightly to demonstrate the absence of 9th grade, the representation of THS remains the same as a top performing school.
