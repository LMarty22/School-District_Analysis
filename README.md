## Overview 

---Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Upon completion of the initial school district data analysis for Py City schools, Maria was notified that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. Due to the highly confidential nature of student scores and money distribution based on scores, it is imperative that scores are reported accurately for future budgeting forecasting. As a result, analysis must be completed once more, representative of the removal of Thomas High School(THS) student data for 9th graders.

Cabrera High School per student funding is in the first percentile, however it has the highest overall passing percentage in the district at 91.33%. Meanwhile the lowest performing school, Rodriguez High School funding per student is the 3rd percentile.
